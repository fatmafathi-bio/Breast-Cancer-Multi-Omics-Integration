# Breast-Cancer-Multi-Omics-Integration
This project performs a multi-omics integration of TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA) data using **Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA+)**. The goal is to identify latent factors that drive biological variation across transcriptomics (RNA-seq), copy number variations (CNV), and proteomics (RPPA), and link these factors to patient survival.
